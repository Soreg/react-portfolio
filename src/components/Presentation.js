            Hello, and welcome to my wonderful world of programming! My name is Soren, and I am a passionate web developer. I love to stay up to date with new trends, and I always devote time to 'upgrade' myself. I know a variety of languages, mostly related to front-end development.
          </p>

            My programming journey started around 5 years ago, when I got introduced to C# in a class I was taking. I was hooked from the first day, and I have been ever since! I quickly changed from C# to Html, Css and Javascript, and also started working with PHP and SQL. My current focus is ReactJS!
